# SmartSlideMaster
This project aims to demonstrate the development of a Presentation System based on Hand Gestures. The system will enable users to navigate through slides using hand gestures, providing both forward and backward movement options, as well as pointer.
This code imports essential libraries for building a hand gesture-based presentation system. Firstly, the "os" library facilitates interactions with the operating system, often used for file operations. Secondly, "cv2" represents the OpenCV library, renowned for its image and video processing capabilities. Thirdly, "cvzone.HandTrackingModule" is likely a custom module built on OpenCV, tailored for hand detection and tracking tasks. Lastly, "numpy" is providing powerful array manipulation tools for scientific computing tasks. Together, these libraries form the foundation for developing an interactive presentation system that responds to hand gestures.
